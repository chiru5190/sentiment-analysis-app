# 📊 Sentiment Analysis App
A machine learning powered web application that classifies text sentiment (Positive, Negative, Neutral) using TF-IDF features and supervised ML models.  
The app is built with Streamlit and supports **single text prediction** as well as **bulk sentiment analysis**.

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup

### 1️⃣ Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Sentiment-Analysis-App.git

```
2️⃣ Install required dependencies
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3️⃣ Run the Streamlit app
```
streamlit run app.py
```
🎯 How It Works

User inputs text (or uploads a CSV).
The system preprocesses text: cleaning, normalization, tokenizing.
TF-IDF converts text to numerical vectors.
A trained ML model predicts Positive, Negative, or Neutral.
Streamlit displays results with a clean and interactive layout.
