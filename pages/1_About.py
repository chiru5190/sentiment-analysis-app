This application is an interactive tool for sentiment analysis. It uses a machine learning model to classify text into **Positive**, **Negative**, or **Neutral** categories.

st.markdown("""
This project was built to demonstrate a simple, end-to-end MLOps workflow:
-   **Model Training:** A sentiment analysis model was trained and evaluated in a separate environment (e.g., a Jupyter Notebook).
-   **Model Serialization:** The trained model and its associated vectorizer were saved to disk using `joblib`.
-   **Deployment:** The serialized artifacts are loaded into this Streamlit web application, which provides an interactive user interface for real-time predictions.
-   **Containerization (Optional):** The app is ready to be containerized with Docker for scalable and reproducible deployment.

    The sentiment analysis pipeline consists of two key components:
    -   **TF-IDF Vectorizer:** Converts raw text into numerical vectors. It highlights words that are important to a comment relative to their frequency across all comments.
    -   **Logistic Regression Model:** A robust and interpretable classification algorithm that predicts the sentiment based on the vectorized text. It was trained on a labeled dataset of social media comments, achieving over 80% accuracy.
